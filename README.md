# 100 Cims 3D

This tool is based on [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org/index.html), a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to create 2D and 3D globes and maps in the web browser without the need of a plug-in. Cesium is open source under the Apache 2.0 license and is free for commercial and non-commercial use.

As a demonstrator of what Cesium allows, we have added a set of layers that you can activate. This way you can see the icons that pinpoints the 100 most emblematic peaks of Catalonia, navigate from the drop-down menu and see its information.

The geoinformation we have used to create this scenario is our 5 meters resolution digital terrain model of Catalonia.
